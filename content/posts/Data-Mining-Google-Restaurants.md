## Abstract
This project attempts to predict an arbitrary customerâ€™s star rating of a restaurant from the provided Google Restaurants Dataset, specifically from the filtered subset dataset. Following an exploratory analysis of the data, we decided that the best approach to predicting the star ratings would be through text mining utilizing linear regression. Our methodology involved multiple experiments on the training set to determine the optimal number of words to include in our feature vector. To enhance the predictive capabilities of our model, we conducted operations on the predicted values of our valid set, including clipping to minimum and maximum values of the star ratings, as well as rounding, thereby refining our predictions against the baseline. Notably, our investigation revealed that the leftward skewness and non-Gaussian distribution of the star ratings graph resulted in the most negatively weighted words possessing greater magnitudes than their positively weighted counterparts in the linear regression model's theta coefficients.

**loading datasets (train, valid, test)**

dataset = json.load(open('filter_all_t.json'))
trainSet = dataset['train']
valSet = dataset['val']

## Exploratory Analysis

**Determing the distribution of ratings (y) in the database**


```python
ratingsList = [d['rating'] for d in trainSet]
plt.hist(ratingsList, bins=range(1,7))
plt.show()
```

**Average rating score**


```python
avgRatingScore = sum(ratingsList) / len(ratingsList)
avgRatingScore
```




    4.465252318619057



**Average number of `history_reviews` per review**


```python
histReviews = [len(d['history_reviews']) for d in trainSet]
sum(histReviews) / len(histReviews)
```




    3.3998368059945068



**Average number of pictures per review**


```python
numOfPictures = [len(d['pics']) for d in trainSet]
sum(numOfPictures) / len(numOfPictures)
```




    1.8681001689402732



**Checking for overlapping users between the sets**


```python
usersTrain = set()
restaurantsTrain = set()

for d in trainSet:
    usersTrain.add(d['user_id'])
    restaurantsTrain.add(d['business_id'])

usersValid = set()
restaurantsValid = set()

for d in valSet:
    usersValid.add(d['user_id'])
    restaurantsValid.add(d['business_id'])

# usersTest = set()
# restaurantsTest = set()

# for d in testSet:
#     usersTest.add(d['user_id'])
#     restaurantsTest.add(d['business_id'])

print("number of overlapping users between train and valid set: ", len(usersTrain.intersection(usersValid)))
print("number of overlapping restaurants between train and valid set: ", len(restaurantsTrain.intersection(restaurantsValid)))
```

    number of overlapping users between train and valid set:  0
    number of overlapping restaurants between train and valid set:  6282


## Model

**Bag-of-Words model**


```python
reviewWordCount = defaultdict(int)
punctuation = set(string.punctuation)

# getting all words that are not punctuation, making sure upper/lower case doesn't matter
for d in trainSet:
  r = ''.join([c for c in d['review_text'].lower() if not c in punctuation])
  for w in r.split():
    reviewWordCount[w] += 1

print("number of unqiue review words: ", len(reviewWordCount))
reviewCounts = [(reviewWordCount[w], w) for w in reviewWordCount]
reviewCounts.sort(reverse=True)

# top 3000 most popular words from reviewCounts
reviewWords = [x[1] for x in reviewCounts[:3000]]
reviewWordId = dict(zip(reviewWords, range(len(reviewWords)))) 
```

    number of unqiue review words:  38456


**Sentiment Analysis**


```python
def feature(datum):
    vector1 = [0]*len(reviewWords)
    r = ''.join([c for c in datum['review_text'].lower() if not c in punctuation])
    for w in r.split():
        if w in reviewWords:
            vector1[reviewWordId[w]] += 1

    return vector1 + [len(datum['pics'])] + [len(datum['history_reviews'])] + [1] 

X = [feature(d) for d in trainSet]
y = [d['rating'] for d in trainSet]

# Regularized regression
model = linear_model.Ridge(1.0, fit_intercept=False)
model.fit(X, y)

xVal, yVal = [feature(d) for d in valSet], [d['rating'] for d in valSet]
predVal = model.predict(xVal)

for i in range(len(predVal)):
    if predVal[i] > 5: predVal[i] = 5
    elif predVal[i] < 1: predVal[i] = 1
    else: predVal[i] = round(predVal[i])


MAE = mean_absolute_error(yVal, predVal)
print(MAE)

xTest, yTest = [feature(d) for d in testSet], [d['rating'] for d in testSet]
predTest = model.predict(xTest)

for i in range(len(predTest)):
    if predTest[i] > 5: predTest[i] = 5
    elif predTest[i] < 1: predTest[i] = 1
    else: predTest[i] = round(predTest[i])

MAE = mean_absolute_error(yTest, predTest)
print(MAE)
```

    0.4778084714548803
    0.4667271901951884



```python
avgRatingList = [avgRatingScore for _ in yVal]
baseline = mean_absolute_error(yVal, avgRatingList)
print("baseline: ", baseline)
```

    baseline:  0.6807998737048648


**10 most negatively weighted words and 10 most positively weighted words**


```python
theta = model.coef_
wordsWeight = [(theta[i], reviewWords[i]) for i in range(len(reviewWords))]
wordsWeight.sort()
print("bottom weighted words: \n", wordsWeight[:10])
wordsWeight.sort(reverse=True)
print("top weighted words: \n", wordsWeight[:10])
```
